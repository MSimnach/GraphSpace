# GraphSpace
Graph Space Package

This python package allow study population of networks in Graph Space [1] as a special case of Structure Space introduced in [2].
The package is organized as follow:

core:
- Graph: class creating a graph object
- GraphSet: class creating a graph set
- Mean: class computing the Frechèt Mean and the variance of a set of graphs [2]
- MeanIterative: bootstrapped version of Frechèt Mean [2]

distance:
- euclidean: compute the euclidean distance between nodes and vector attributes

matcher:
- Matcher: parent class created to match two graphs
- child classes: whatever algorithm used to match two different networks, based on topology, node attributes and edge attributes. 
Child class gives back a reordered node sequence optimizing the matching criteria
    ID: identity match
    GA: graduate assignment match[2]
    GAS, GAS1: solving directly the optimization problem (GAS1 tackles the linearized version)
- alignment: class aligning two graphs with a specified matcher

AlignCompute:
- mean_aac: compute the Frechet Mean with the AAC algorithm and a given matcher [1]
- gpca_aac: compute the Geodesic Principal Components with AAC and a given matcher [1]
- ggr_aac: compute the Generalized Geodesic Regression with AAC and a given matcher [1]
